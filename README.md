# Sakila.API
REST API used to interact with the MySql Sakila Test Database.

Sakila is a normalized database revolving around a Movie rental store (woof thats old) provided by MySql dev environment. 
This all came about from the desire to learn more about other databases to test and play in. 

The objective was to create a database and fill it with some dummy data and write a backend CRUD system as a learning excercise to then later implement with my notes-api repo. 
But because we found the Sakila database with plentiful test data, I decided to just spin up a REST api with that as the database to practice things such as.
  1) Spinning up a .net 7 Web API
  2) Learning more about Entity Framework Core
  3) Refining my knowledge on SOLID principles and dependency injection design pattern
  4) Later to hopefully create a front end site in a JS framework (TBD) to learn more there.
  5) Learn more about deploying of .NET APIs and CI/CD while playing with things such as Docker, Kubernetes etc.

Still a work in progress :).
